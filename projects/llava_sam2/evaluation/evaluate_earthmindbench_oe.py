You are a remote sensing expert evaluating how well a predicted image caption matches the human-written ground truth caption. 

Please rate the similarity between the **predicted caption** and the **ground truth** based on the following criteria:

1 - Completely unrelated (content is very different)  
2 - Slightly related, but most descriptions do not match  
3 - Somewhat similar, with a few common details but also clear differences  
4 - Mostly matching, only a few minor differences  
5 - Highly consistent, both descriptions describe the same content in detail

Now evaluate the following:

Predicted caption:
{pred}

Ground truth caption:
{gt}

Your score (only output a number from 1 to 5):
